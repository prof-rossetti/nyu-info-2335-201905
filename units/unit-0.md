# Unit 0: Onboarding

Welcome to INFO 2335 (Programming in Python & Fundamentals of Software Development)!

To prepare for the first class, please complete all of the onboarding activities below.

## NYU Classes

Ensure you can access the [course site in NYU Classes](https://newclasses.nyu.edu/portal/site/e7aed58f-c4e8-4fbd-b8ab-40c86414d0ab/). If you encounter any issues, notify the professor.

## Syllabus

Read and comprehend [the Syllabus](/SYLLABUS.pdf) in its entirety. If you have any questions, notify the professor.

## GitHub

Unless you already have one, please take a moment to [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/). We'll use this platform to manage, share, and submit different versions of our Python projects.

Afterwards, consider signing up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack), which provides some free resources.

> PRIVACY OPTIONS: Many students wish to associate their personal identities with their GitHub accounts, to display a portfolio of programming projects. However, if you're concerned about privacy, you have a few options. First, consider choosing a GitHub username which is different than your university-issued net identifier. Second, avoid uploading any personally-identifiable information to your GitHub profile. Third, sign up for the Student Developer Pack, which will allow you to submit projects via private repositories.

## Onboarding Survey

After creating a GitHub account, please submit this short [Onboarding Survey](https://forms.gle/aLCFvoVfQkRJmu3z5). Your responses help the professor tailor the course to suit your interests and preferences.

## Anaconda

Anaconda provides various command-line utilities for installing and managing different versions of the Python programming language and its third-party packages.

Unless it is already installed, download [Anaconda Version 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/download) for either Mac or Windows. During the installation, you should remember to check the option to "Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable". See the professor's [Anaconda installation reference](/notes/clis/conda.md#installation) for more details.


## Text Editor

Unless you already have a programming-class text editor of choice, please install the [VS Code text editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/). We'll use this software to save and edit files of Python code.

## GitHub Desktop

Unless you already have a Git client of choice, please install the [GitHub Desktop software](https://desktop.github.com/) and login with your GitHub account credentials. We'll use this software to upload our Python projects to the GitHub platform.

## Git

GitHub Desktop software will require the Git command-line utility to be installed on our computers. So let's install Git now. See the professor's [Git installation reference](/notes/clis/git.md#installation) for more details.

This installation should also install a program called Git Bash, which Windows users will use as their default command-line computing application.

## Slack

When invited by the professor on the first day of class, please join the [course Slack organization](https://nyu-info-2335.slack.com/). We'll use this platform to communicate with each other, and to share links and snippets of Python code.
