# The "Freestyle" Project

> Prerequisite: [Technology Management, and the Systems Development Lifecycle (SDLC)](/units/unit-6.md)

The Self-Directed (a.k.a. "Freestyle") Project provides students with the flexibility and support to create basic application software to suit their own business or personal interests.

> GROUP OPTION: Students have the option of working by themselves, or in groups of up to three members. Group membership designations must be specified during the proposal phase. For evaluation purposes, projects will be ranked against others of the same group composition (e.g. solo projects vs other solo projects, two-person teams vs other two-person teams, and three-person teams against other three-person teams). To incentivize individual effort within larger groups, each group member will be asked to submit a form describing and rating the roles and relative contributions of all other group members.

## Learning Objectives

  + Propose and implement a software solution to address some real-life problem and the needs of real users.
  + Participate in the entire Systems Development Lifecycle, including system planning, analysis, design, implementation, and maintenance.
  + Follow personal interests and passions, and find an outlet for creative expression.
  + Optional: Practice collaborating on a software project with other individuals.

## Scope and Subject Matter

The project's scope should be roughly equivalent or greater than previous "guided" projects. Students can choose whatever subject matter is interesting for them, but should prefer to achieve a unique set of functionality.

## Phases

First students will brainstorm and submit a proposal outlining their project's scope, objectives, and requirements. Then students will implement the requirements by writing their own Python applications.

  1. Proposal Phase (Learning and Planning)
  2. Implementation Phase (Building and Testing)
