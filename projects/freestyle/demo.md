# "Freestyle" Project Demonstration

> Prerequisites:
>   + [The "Freestyle" Project Proposal](/projects/freestyle/proposal.md)
>   + [The "Freestyle" Project Implementation](/projects/freestyle/implementation.md), ideally but not necessarily completed before the demo

## Learning Objectives

  + Show-off your hard work to the rest of the class.
  + Practice communicating technology concepts at a high-level for an audience of potentially-non-technical individuals.
  + Learn more about the other student projects, share knowledge with each other, and celebrate in each other's successes.

## Instructions

Prepare a five minute presentation to share your project with the rest of the class. It should be in Google Slides or MS PowerPoint format, and should generally include the following slides / components:

  1. Introduction
  2. Problem Statement / User Needs
  3. Proposed Solution / Info Requirements
  4. Live Demo
  5. Reflections (optional)

## Sections

### Introduction

Introduce yourself and your project's name and subject matter.

### Problem Statement / User Needs

Describe the problem addressed by your project. Who are the affected users and what are their needs?

### Proposed Solution / Info Requirements

Describe your proposed solution to the problem, including a high-level Data Flow Diagram (DFD). What does it do? At a high-level, describe how it works, how users interact with it, and any other services or platforms it interfaces with.

### Live Demo

Transition into a live demonstration of your project in action. Depending on which day you are scheduled to present, you might not have completed development of all aspects of your project. If you have not yet completed your project, choose a small component to demo, or demo the results of your investigation efforts into the system's technical feasibility.

### Reflections

Remark on your reactions to the process. For example, you might address the following questions:

  + What was the hardest part of the planning and/or implementation processes? Did you run into any unforeseen issues?
  + How did you prioritize features? For groups, how did you split up the work?
  + What did you learn while working on this project? How did you learn what you needed to learn? Did you find any helpful resources?
  + What went well, and/or what would you do differently next time?

## Submission Instructions

The professor will assign your group to present on one of two "Demo Days".

At least an hour before the beginning of class on your designated demo day, [upload a PDF version of your presentation document to NYU Classes](https://newclasses.nyu.edu/portal/site/e7aed58f-c4e8-4fbd-b8ab-40c86414d0ab/tool/f1178530-8a47-4ef7-831d-d554df55b4eb?assignmentId=/assignment/a/e7aed58f-c4e8-4fbd-b8ab-40c86414d0ab/ea14ea83-1336-4949-b945-d46aaf6b0146&panel=Main&sakai_action=doView_assignment).

During the first few minutes of class on your designated demo day, practice connecting your computer to the projector using either of the provided VGA or HDMI cables.

After the group scheduled to present before you starts to take questions, begin setting up your computer by connecting it to the projector and preparing to demo.

During your designated demo time, deliver your presentation in front of the class. When you are finished, step to the side to answer questions while the next group sets up.

## Evaluation

Presentations will be evaluated on the basis of content and delivery. Strive to deliver presentations with clarity and confidence. Impressive and memorable demonstrations are a great way to earn top grades. The professor may ask other students in the audience to evaluate the presentations, in which case these peer evaluations will be factored into the final presentation grade.
