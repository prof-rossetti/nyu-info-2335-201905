The `sendgrid` package provides some useful emailing capabilities via the [SendGrid Email Delivery Service](https://sendgrid.com/solutions/email-api/). :mailbox_with_mail: :envelope:

  + [Obtaining API Keys](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys)

## Installation

From within a virtual environment, install `sendgrid`, if necessary:

```sh
pip install sendgrid==6.0.5
```

> NOTE: previous versions of these instructions were applicable for sendgrid package version 5.6.0, but the examples below apply to a more current version (6.0.5)

## Setup

First, [sign up for a free account](https://signup.sendgrid.com/), then click the link in a confirmation email to verify your account. Then [create an API Key](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys) with "full access" permissions.

To setup the usage examples below, store the API Key value in an environment variable called `SENDGRID_API_KEY`. Also set an environment variable called `MY_EMAIL_ADDRESS` to be the email address you just associated with your SendGrid account (e.g. "abc123@gmail.com").

## Usage

Send yourself an email:

```py

import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from sendgrid import SendGridAPIClient
from sendgrid.helpers.mail import Mail

load_dotenv()

SENDGRID_API_KEY = os.environ.get("SENDGRID_API_KEY", "OOPS, please set env var called 'SENDGRID_API_KEY'")
MY_ADDRESS = os.environ.get("MY_EMAIL_ADDRESS", "OOPS, please set env var called 'MY_EMAIL_ADDRESS'")

client = SendGridAPIClient(SENDGRID_API_KEY) #> <class 'sendgrid.sendgrid.SendGridAPIClient>
print("CLIENT:", type(client))

subject = "Your Receipt from the Green Grocery Store"

html_content = "Hello World"
#
# or maybe ...
#html_content = "Hello <strong>World</strong>"
#
# or maybe ...
#html_list_items = "<li>You ordered: Product 1</li>"
#html_list_items += "<li>You ordered: Product 2</li>"
#html_list_items += "<li>You ordered: Product 3</li>"
#html_content = f"""
#<h3>Hello this is your receipt</h3>
#<p>Date: ____________</p>
#<ol>
#    {html_list_items}
#</ol>
#"""
print("HTML:", html_content)

message = Mail(from_email=MY_ADDRESS, to_emails=MY_ADDRESS, subject=subject, html_content=html_content)

try:
    response = client.send(message)

    print("RESPONSE:", type(response)) #> <class 'python_http_client.client.Response'>
    print(response.status_code) #> 202 indicates SUCCESS
    print(response.body)
    print(response.headers)

except Exception as e:
    print("OOPS", e.message)

```

> NOTE: the message was successfully sent if you see a 202 status code

### Email Templates

> Thanks to @mgallea for surfacing these email template capabilities

If you'd like further control over the content displayed in the email's body, you can use Sendgrid's email templates.

Reference:

  + https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-transactional-templates/

Let's try sending a simple receipt:

![](/img/notes/python/packages/sendgrid/receipt-screenshot.png)

Navigate to https://sendgrid.com/dynamic_templates and press the "Create Template" button on the top right. Give it a name like "example-receipt", and click "Save". At this time, you should see your template's unique identifier (e.g. "d-b902ae61c68f40dbbd1103187a9736f0"). Copy this value and store it in an environment variable called `SENDGRID_TEMPLATE_ID`.

![](/img/notes/python/packages/sendgrid/create-template.png)

Back in the SendGrid platform, click "Add Version" to create a new version of this template and select the "Code Editor" as your desired editing mechanism.

![](/img/notes/python/packages/sendgrid/create-template-version.png)

At this point you should be able to paste the following HTML into the "Code" tab, and the corresponding example data in the "Test Data" tab:

```html
<img src="https://www.shareicon.net/data/128x128/2016/05/04/759867_food_512x512.png">

<h3>Hello this is your receipt</h3>

<p>Date: {{human_friendly_timestamp}}</p>

<p>Total: {{total_price_usd}}</p>

<ul>
{{#each products}}
	<li>You ordered: {{this.name}}</li>
{{/each}}
</ul>
```

> NOTE: the ["handlebars" syntax above](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/using-handlebars) is like HTML, but allows us to construct HTML dynamically based on some data like the example below

```py
{
    "total_price_usd": "$14.95",
    "human_friendly_timestamp": "July 4th, 2019 10:00 AM",
    "products":[
        {"id":1, "name": "Product 1"},
        {"id":2, "name": "Product 2"},
        {"id":3, "name": "Product 3"},
        {"id":2, "name": "Product 2"},
        {"id":1, "name": "Product 1"}
    ]
}
```



Finally, configure the template's subject by clicking on "Settings" in the left sidebar. Choose an email subject like "Your Receipt from the Green Grocery Store". Then click "Save Template".

![](/img/notes/python/packages/sendgrid/template-settings.png)

After configuring and saving the email template, we should be able to send an email using the template:

```py
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from sendgrid import SendGridAPIClient
from sendgrid.helpers.mail import Mail

load_dotenv()

SENDGRID_API_KEY = os.environ.get("SENDGRID_API_KEY", "OOPS, please set env var called 'SENDGRID_API_KEY'")
SENDGRID_TEMPLATE_ID = os.environ.get("SENDGRID_TEMPLATE_ID", "OOPS, please set env var called 'SENDGRID_TEMPLATE_ID'")
MY_ADDRESS = os.environ.get("MY_EMAIL_ADDRESS", "OOPS, please set env var called 'MY_EMAIL_ADDRESS'")

#print("API KEY:", SENDGRID_API_KEY)
#print("TEMPLATE ID:", SENDGRID_TEMPLATE_ID)
#print("EMAIL ADDRESS:", MY_ADDRESS)

template_data = {
    "total_price_usd": "$14.95",
    "human_friendly_timestamp": "June 1st, 2019 10:00 AM",
    "products":[
        {"id":1, "name": "Product 1"},
        {"id":2, "name": "Product 2"},
        {"id":3, "name": "Product 3"},
        {"id":2, "name": "Product 2"},
        {"id":1, "name": "Product 1"}
    ]
} # or construct this dictionary dynamically based on the results of some other process :-D

client = SendGridAPIClient(SENDGRID_API_KEY)
print("CLIENT:", type(client))

message = Mail(from_email=MY_ADDRESS, to_emails=MY_ADDRESS)
print("MESSAGE:", type(message))

message.template_id = SENDGRID_TEMPLATE_ID

message.dynamic_template_data = template_data

try:
    response = client.send(message)
    print("RESPONSE:", type(response))
    print(response.status_code)
    print(response.body)
    print(response.headers)

except Exception as e:
    print("OOPS", e)
```
