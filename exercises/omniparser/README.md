# Data Processing (a.k.a. "Omniparser") Exercise

> Prerequisites:
>   + [Datastores, and Processing CSV Data](/units/unit-4.md)
>   + [The `csv` Module](/notes/python/modules/csv.md), or [The `pandas` Package](/notes/python/packages/pandas.md)

## Learning Objectives

  + Practice using Python to process differently-formatted files of machine-readable data (e.g. CSV, TXT, JSON, etc.).
  + Practice researching and leveraging the capabilities provided by Python modules and third-party packages.

## Setup

Fork, then clone the professor's ["Omniparser Starter" repo](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/omniparser-starter-py), which contains starter code and all the data files you'll need to perform the exercise. Then follow the setup instructions contained within the "README" file of that repo to create and activate a new virtual environment and prepare for project development.

## Instructions

Follow the instructions contained within the "README" file of that repo. Your goal is to make the respective tests pass by implementing logic to process each of the provided data files.

## Submission Instructions

Submission of this exercise is optional, but if you'd like to take this opportunity to practice the project submission process, consult the [Contributor's Guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md) and follow the steps below:

  1. Push your local project repository to GitHub, so you can visit your remote project repository at a URL like `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/omniparser`
  2. Fork the ["upstream" course repository](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201905) (or refresh your existing fork)
  3. Update the ["submissions.csv"](submissions.csv) file in your remote fork of the course repository to include an entry linking to your remote project repository URL
  4. Finally, submit a Pull Request for the changes in your remote fork of the course repository to be accepted back into the "upstream" course repository

This process may seem a little unfamiliar at the moment, but it will become more familiar with each repetition.
