# "Monthly Sales Predictions" Exercise

> Prerequisites:
>   + [Dataviz and Business Analytics](/units/unit-4b.md)
>   + ["Monthly Sales Reporting" Exercise](/exercises/monthly-sales-reporting/README.md)

> WARNING: intended for students with experience and interest in statistics

## Setup

Use the same repo with monthly sales CSV data files you used for the "Monthly Sales Reporting" exercise, or make a copy of that repo called something like "monthly-sales-predictions" and add the same CSV files into that new repo.

Make sure your repo includes all available ["monthly sales data"](/data/monthly-sales) CSV files.

## Instructions

Research and leverage third-party Python packages to predict top-level monthly sales for each of the next twelve months following the latest available month of available data.

## Further Exploration Challenges

Can you predict the monthly sales for each item?

## Submission Instructions

Submission of this exercise is optional, but if you'd like to take this opportunity to practice the project submission process, consult the [Contributor's Guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md) and follow the steps below:

  1. Push your local project repository to GitHub, so you can visit your remote project repository at a URL like `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/monthly-sales`
  2. Fork the ["upstream" course repository](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201905) (or refresh your existing fork)
  3. Update the ["submissions.csv"](submissions.csv) file in your remote fork of the course repository to include an entry linking to your remote project repository URL
  4. Finally, submit a Pull Request for the changes in your remote fork of the course repository to be accepted back into the "upstream" course repository

This process may seem a little unfamiliar at the moment, but it will become more familiar with each repetition.
